Hey there! My name is Manish and I'm a researcher interested in trustworthy machine learning. Some representative projects include:
* developing efficient and provably capable guardrails for unsafe input and output detection
* deploying inclusive and participatory red-teaming sessions for targeted model improvement

I am currently focused on safety alignment, synthetic data generation, and use-case centered evaluations all in the context of LLMs.

Previously, I worked on aspects of trustworthiness in the non-generative (i.e., tabular) setting. I am a core maintainer for many open-source trustworthy AI toolkits - [AI Fairness 360](https://aif360.res.ibm.com/), [AI Explainability 360](https://aix360.res.ibm.com/), and [Uncertainty Quantification 360](https://uq360.res.ibm.com/). 

Before joining IBM Research, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in statistics, machine learning, and computer science. At CMU, I fell in love with trustworthy ML (and research in general) through working on algorithmic fairness with incredible mentors and colleagues - including [Haiyi Zhu](https://haiyizhu.com/), [Steven Wu](https://zstevenwu.com/), [Hoda Heidari](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hheidari/), and [Wesley Deng](https://www.wesleydeng.com/).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
